# Using FT8 to Benchmark Station Rx/Tx Performance
## Introduction
This page is about my personal exploration of ways to check that I'm getting the best possible performance out of my ham radio station, given the constraints I have. Every ham radio station
has constraints of *some* kind, and part of the fun of the hobby for me is working out how to do the best with the situation you're in. Getting instant signal reports in volume from pskreporter 
is a huge help in achieving this.

## My station
I live in a conservation area where no outside antennas are permitted, so everything I use is indoors. Despite this, when I look at pskreporter, I often have the longest
distance reach, and largest coverage area, of stations operating from my country (England), on what I would call some of the most difficult bands; 80m, 160m, and 2m. And that's on
both transmit and receive with a single Icom IC-7100 as the station transceiver. No external pre-amps or linear power amplifiers. I'm not claiming
to 'win' all the time; clearly there are many stations with long Yagis reaching far into Europe on 2m and stations with superb receiving antennas in remote locations who do far 
better than I do. But what I do know is that I'm winning the battle against local QRM and using antennas that work well on transmit too, and I'm *absolutely* doing better than at least half
of other stations irrespective of location.
