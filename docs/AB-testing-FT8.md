# Using FT8 to Benchmark Station Rx/Tx Performance
## Introduction
This page is about my personal exploration of ways to check that I'm getting the best possible performance out of my ham radio station, given the constraints I have. Every ham radio station
has constraints of *some* kind, and part of the fun of the hobby for me is working out how to do the best with the situation you're in. Getting instant signal reports in volume from pskreporter 
is a huge help in achieving this.

## My station
I live in a conservation area where no outside antennas are permitted, so everything I use is indoors. Despite this, when I look at pskreporter, I often have the longest
distance reach, and largest coverage area, of stations operating from my country (England), on what I would call some of the most difficult bands; 80m, 160m, and 2m. And that's on
both transmit and receive with a single Icom IC-7100 as the station transceiver. I'm not claiming
to 'win' all the time; clearly there are many stations with long Yagis reaching far into Europe on 2m and stations with superb receiving antennas in remote locations who do far 
better than I do. But what I do know is that I'm winning the battle against local QRM and using antennas that work well on transmit too, and I'm *absolutely* doing better than at least half
of other stations irrespective of location.

### TL;DR - the antennas
I've worked with attic antennas in two houses now over the last decade, and found that it's pretty easy to set up a fan dipole to cover at least 20m to 10m if not 40m to 6m. What I use 
currently is:
160, 80, 60, 40: Small transmitting loop 7.5m circumference made from 10mm copper tube
20, 15, 17, 10, 6m: fan dipole (I don't have 30m and 12m currently)
2m - my G1OJS Contraspiral

The thing that has made the most difference though is the addition of an active receive loop to these antennas for HF work. I use an LZ1AQ amplifier with a small loop made from 20mm wide 
aluminium strip, right at the top of the attic. Using the fan dipoles for Rx results in a very high noise floor even with careful minimisation (and measurement of) common mode currents. 
I have previously used an end-fed wire cut to 20m length, bent into a U shape to fit in my 5m x 5m attic space, which was great on transmit but even worse on receive than the fan dipoles as 
you would expect!
